# Spellcheck

I suck at spelling and this project was supposed to help me be better but it actually just made me accept that spelling is very hard. Anyway, here's the website assets including the audio clips. The actual process of generating new audio prompts can be found in this YouTube video: <https://youtu.be/KK3mS4bQ5JM>

## Known Issues

# Known Issues
=======
* Pronunciation goes very rogue at points
  * Examples: very, ascension, porcelain, rosin, reveille, hat, upon, portcullus, innovator, pie, vineyard, concatenate, javas, thrasonical, annual, fribourg, rubric, retrodict, expatiated, hem, hermeneutics, wizard, arsenic, power, expression, longitude, accordance, gonzo, toga, epoch
* Submit button on mobile is too close to keys - it might be worth just switching to a mobile keyboard
* On-screen keyboard is very laggy
* Spelling system is inconsistent between British and American spelling
  * Examples: medival, squints
* "A adjective" - my bad, I forgot adjectives existed
* Some ChatGPT etymology calls returned something akin to "My apologies, I do not understand your request"
  * Examples: aerials, autographs, scrambling
* Accidental refresh removes progress - may be better to store results into local storage (but also I have no idea if this will store results into a new day)
* Submitting on first word in practice mode will allow you to go into negative lives lmao
* Copy results sometimes fails (someone has recommended a fix)

## Possible Extensions

* Mass select + deleter character inputs
* Inserting characters without erasing
* Multiple accept options
* A version with game rooms and folks could follow the more traditional round and elimination format in spelling bees.
* Adding more words
* Word playback on results page
* Ability to store list of words for future practice
